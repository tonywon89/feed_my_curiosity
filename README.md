FeedMyCuriosity is a full-stack web application designed to allow readers to have access to feeds from a variety of news websites. The idea was inspired by <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a>, and utilizes Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with a Flux architectural framework on the frontend.
